Hi dears <br/>

database is sqlite and schema :
![SCHEMA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8627007/181023409-d98eafbb-9ea7-4e64-82bb-f03e92192a3b.png)

code is written in Kotlin language and its database is sqlite. <br/>
Features such as making words favorite and Lightner`s box can help the process of learning words better.  <br/>
If you can add these features to this project or you want to implement your new idea separately or on the same source code, you are free to do so.  <br/> <br/>
Thanks  <br/>
