# Vazheh Dictionary

Hi dears <br/>
This code is written in Kotlin language and its database is sqlite. <br/>
Features such as making words favorite and Lightner box can help the process of learning words better.  <br/>
If you can add these facilities to this project or you want to implement your new idea separately or on the same source code, you are free to do so.  <br/> <br/>
Thanks  <br/>
